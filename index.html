      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hey! My name's Ami and I'm a recent pre-med graduate from Johns Hopkins University</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Bonn, Germany, but my family moved to the U.S. when I was four and we've lived in New York every since.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies are music (piano and singing), video games, and working out</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is being the front man of a band. I'm a huge fan of Freddie Mercury and Queen, and I love his stage presence and their contributions to music.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Pelham, NY</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I find the field really interesting, and I really want to make my own websites. It's something I didn't really get to explore as much as I wanted to in college and I decided to switch from my pre-med track to software engineering.</p>
